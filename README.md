Desirable functionalities:
1. It would be great to have a feature where people can know what are the nearest vaccination centres are
2. Another add on could be collaborating with docotrs just in case people need to access them
3. For Seniors, it would be great to have audio/video call feature to talk to volunteers
4. It would be great  to have a feature where all the data for person's vaccination can be kept at one spot for their personal reference.
5. Children can made aware about COVID-19 and its precautions by adding some kind of cool game feature which enhances their knowledge.
